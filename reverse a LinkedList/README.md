### Problem
Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a linked list. Change the next pointers of the nodes so that their order is reversed. The head pointer given may be null meaning that the initial list is empty.

### Input Format
You have to complete the SinglyLinkedListNode reverse(SinglyLinkedListNode head) method which takes one argument - the head of the linked list. You should NOT read any input from stdin/console.

The input is handled by the code in the editor and the format is as follows:

The first line contains an integer t, denoting the number of test cases.
Each test case is of the following format:

The first line contains an integer n, denoting the number of elements in the linked list.
The next n lines contain an integer each, denoting the elements of the linked list.
